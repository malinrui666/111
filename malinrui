# cnn-cifar-10

A PyTorch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project covers data loading, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## 🚀 Features

* **Data Preprocessing**
  Automatically downloads and prepares the CIFAR-10 dataset with normalization and optional data augmentation.

* **Model Architecture**
  Defines a standard CNN consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, batch normalization, ReLU activations, and fully connected layers.

* **Training Pipeline**
  Includes a complete training loop: forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, optimizer update, and best-model checkpoint saving.

* **Evaluation**
  Evaluates the trained model on the test set, reports classification accuracy, and optionally generates plots for loss/accuracy over time.

* **Visualization**
  Provides support for visualizing training progress and prediction results using plots.

## 🧪 Demo Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/definfo/cnn-cifar-10.git
   cd cnn-cifar-10
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the Model**

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   * Automatically downloads the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   * Default hyperparameters can be adjusted via command-line arguments.
   * Saves the best-performing model (e.g., `best_model.pth`).

4. **Evaluate the Model**

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model-path best_model.pth
   ```

   * Outputs test accuracy.
   * Optionally generates confusion matrix and class-wise performance metrics.

5. **Run Demo (Optional)**

   If `demo.ipynb` is available, open it in Jupyter Notebook to visualize training curves and sample predictions.

## 🔧 Potential Improvements

* Add advanced data augmentation (e.g., random crop, horizontal flip)
* Replace with deeper architectures (e.g., ResNet)
* Integrate learning rate schedulers or early stopping
* Add additional evaluation metrics (e.g., F1-score, precision, recall)
* Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
